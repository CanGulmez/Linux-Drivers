# Linux-Drivers

Any device driver is basically a program that controls a real hardware. In Linux world, 
drivers are separated into three categories: character, block, network. Each category 
handles the data with different ways. A character device controls the data as character 
like keyword, mouse or speaker. A block device processes the data as chunk of data. We 
can give the SSD, hard disk, eMMC as examples for this category. Network devices just 
are special for network hardwares like wifi card. These handle data as packets.
